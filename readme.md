Prime Engine is an engine developed by Prof. Artem Kovalovs.

I had taken a course on Game Engine Development under Professor Kovalovs in Spring â€˜24.

Prime Engine is written entirely by Professor Kovalovs. 

The assignment for the course involved implementing features into this engine. This repo contains a snippet of some functionalities that I have added to the engine.

## Implementation Details
* This is a small physics demo in which, a soldier collides and slides off a car, and then proceeds to walk off the plane and fall into the nothingness.
# Implementation Details

### Class Structure

1. **Shape**:
    - Defines the shape of the object.
    - Types:
        - **Box**: Used for scene nodes except SoldierNPC, stores AABB coordinates.
        - **Sphere**: Used for SoldierNPC, stores center point and radius.
        - **Plane**: Used for Cobble Plane, stores AABB coordinates.

2. **PhysicsComponent**:
    - Holds:
        - Pointer to its scene node.
        - Shape type.
        - Radius and center point (if Sphere).
        - AABB coordinates (if Plane or Box).
    - Functions:
        - `checkCollisions()`: Checks if the player is colliding with a bounding box.
        - `checkFloor()`: Checks if the player is on the ground.

3. **PhysicsManager**:
    - A singleton class that:
        - Stores a vector of all the physics components present in the scene.
        - Manages a list of pointers to every physics component in the scene.

### Initialization and Population

* **Adding Physics Components**:
    - **SoldierNPC**: Attach a physics component to its scene node in `SoldierNPC.cpp`.
    - **Other Meshes**: Add physics components to all other meshes where they are made into scene nodes in `GameObjectManager.cpp`.

### Physics Implementation

* **Movement and Collision Handling**:
    - Update the physics component's position with the soldier's movement in `MovementStateMachine.cpp`.
    - Before moving, check for collisions using `checkCollisions()`. If a collision is detected, adjust the NPC's movement direction accordingly.
    - Check if the soldier is still on the cobble plane using `checkFloor()`. If not, adjust the soldier's movement to simulate falling.
